"""
Create .streamlit/secrets.toml with your Gemini key, correctly, in one step.

    python setup_key.py

Why this script exists: creating the file by hand on Windows goes wrong
easily (Notepad saves "secrets.toml.txt", curly quotes, an invisible BOM).
This writes the exact file the app expects, then checks that Git ignores it.
Your key is typed here, stays on your computer, and is never printed.
